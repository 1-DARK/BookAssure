## 1. Problem ❗

Healthcare clinics in India face recurring operational and financial challenges:

- 20–30% of patients do not show up.
- Receptionists spend 2+ hours daily on manual reminder calls.
- Clinics lose ₹35+ lakhs annually due to no-shows.
- Small clinics cannot afford expensive enterprise systems.
- Cancelled slots remain unfilled, resulting in inefficiency and lost revenue.

These issues cost clinics significant time and money.
